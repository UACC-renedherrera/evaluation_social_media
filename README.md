### Bootstrapping (Bootstrap Estimates)


The procedure (Chernick 2007) to obtain an approximation of the bootstrap estimate:


1. Generate a sample with replacement from the empirical distribution (a bootstrap sample),
2. Compute * the value of *ˆθ* (*theta hat*) obtained by using the bootstrap sample in place of the original sample,
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 *k* times. (*k* > 100 )
